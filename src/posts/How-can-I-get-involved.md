We're so glad you asked! Come on over to the [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) repos, and join us in the [Discord chatroom](https://svelte.dev/chat). Everyone is welcome, especially you!

If you enjoy using Contently, you might also want to consider checking out its repo over at [Github](https://github.com/krmax44/contently/). Maybe even leave a little star? ‚≠ê
